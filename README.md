# service.nexttrack
This Kodi add-on is a music-focused variant of the original Up Next add-on. It shows a Netflix-style notification for upcoming tracks during music playback and can automatically continue or stop playback based on your preferences.  Much of the logic and behavior is inherited from the original video-focused Up Next add-on.
