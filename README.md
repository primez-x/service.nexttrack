## Next Track

A music-focused Kodi service addon that shows a notification overlay for the next track in your playlist or music addon. Automatically continues playback to the next song.

Originally forked from the video-focused Up Next addon, Next Track has been fully refactored to focus exclusively on music playback with music-native terminology (tracks, artists, albums).

### Settings
The addon settings are found in the Kodi addons section, in the *Services* category.
